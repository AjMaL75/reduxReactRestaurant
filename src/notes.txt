Api in js
---------
1)xmlhttpRequest
2)fetch
3)async await    --we can store data at a onetime next time we want to getdata that time we will use then

   async  -use before the arguments
   await  -use before the asyncronous method like fetch


 Hook
 ----
 we want to display data when open the component

  useEffect  -use to display the data when open the page
             -when use useEffect it will act as loop ,display the data items continuously
               to solve this problem using [] as second argument of this function 

 Redirection In react
 ---------------------
 react-router-dom       --library used for redirection

 BrowserRouter        --for applying redirection on our app in browser do 0n root component selecter and rap that in BrowserRouter
 Route             --it is used for path setting on each component
 Routes            --if using more than 1 paths must use routes

 Params
 -------
 useParams    -hook is used to access params


 REDUX
 ------
 props drilling  --it is occur when the time of coupling
                 --we want to share data from root component to bottom child component,we can share the data only parent to child that means first share main root to his direct child then that child to his child so on,when the time of do 
                   this there were occured an error in between child component because of this the data not be reached to bottom child this is called props drilling.

 coupling   --connection more when parent to child relation

        solution  ----to avoid props drilling we need to reduce coupling and make all components independent

  --React introduced a state management technology  -redux

  we can use redux there is more connection b/w parent to child when the time of data sharing

  process of redux

         3 libraries are need to do redux

             redux
             react-redux
             redux-thunk


     axios
     ------
     used to call api in react        

     useSelector  -hook is used to access data from store
